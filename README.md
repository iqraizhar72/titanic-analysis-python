# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the Titanic dataset using Python to perform comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. It aims to uncover survival patterns based on features such as gender, age, class, and family relations.

## 📌 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset
- Perform univariate and multivariate analysis
- Visualize survival patterns and correlations
- Derive insights using plots and statistics

## 🧠 Dataset Features

| Feature    | Description                                      |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| survived   | Whether the passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes) |
| pclass     | Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)         |
| sex        | Gender of the passenger                         |
| age        | Age of the passenger                            |
| sibsp      | # of siblings/spouses aboard                    |
| parch      | # of parents/children aboard                    |
| fare       | Ticket fare                                     |
| embarked   | Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton) |
| cabin      | Cabin number                                    |
| ticket     | Ticket number                                   |
| name       | Passenger name                                  |

## 🖼️ Plots & Visualizations

The notebook includes several visualizations created using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**, such as:

- Countplot of overall survival counts  
- Survival comparison by gender and passenger class  
- Age distribution by survival status and gender using box plots  
- Barplot of fare across passenger classes  
- Countplots for family relationships (SibSp and Parch)

> These plots help reveal key patterns and trends in the Titanic dataset.
